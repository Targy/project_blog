# Technical Work

This week, I finished the phase3 of the project and most of the whole porject. Phase 3 is mainly about the character acknowledge he gets the COVID 19 from the doctor. The screen will change color due to dizzy feeling, the effect is shown below.

doctor and effect

Then, the player would finish a few things before he can fall asleep. He would send email to professor about extend the hoemwork and have phone call with his parents. Then he will watch the TV news about protesting if he wasn't witness by himself in phase 2.

After he falls asleep, he will dream about a place where the pandemic is gone and he can talk to others.

I've also add coffee and other food in coffee shop that would increase sanity in phase 2.

To reduce the size of the project, I've removed all the preset musics, pictures and sound effects and end up with windows size 87 MB and mac size 217 MB after compression. I think the windows size might reach to 100 MB after I add the music and sound effects.

The next week, I will add the music, sound effect and playtesting through the game to fix potential bugs and add more interesting objects or events if I have extra time
