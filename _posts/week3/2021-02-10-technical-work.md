# Technical Work

In this week, I set up the RPG maker MZ as the possible platform I will use for the project. RPG Maker MZ is powerful tool which has built in tiles, example maps, character creater and event system. RPG Maker as a steam published platform, has a complete comunity and workshop where I can visit the RPG world built by other player and even use some of the game model created by others. However, the only concern with this pltform is the high price. The selling price on steam is $63.99. Some other tilset such as Modern Urbon tileset, the one that fit my project the most would also cost another $8.99

While using the free trail of the plateform, I create a home of my character. The home generally contains two bedrooms, one bathroom and a kitchen room. The story I currently have in mind is a student who live in a college town alone, seperate from home and parents while experiencing the pandemic. So I make this home like a student apartment with Computer, Sofa, TV, single beds and tables. Because some of the resources/ tileset are not realistic, I might need other tilesets resources for aesthetic purpose

After finishing the build of the first room, I found that it would be better to design before actually make the map. Draft design would also be better if I want to change to other platform. so I have the town and hospital room designed as drafts.

I also create the main character in the platform as a student.The other NPCs could be done in the same way easily

For next weeks, I will continue the design and building map for my game. The Hospital and School scene sets are the first priorities to my game. At the same time, I'm looking forward to have discussion with the psychology professors/ counselor and change the scene set of my game at the same time.
