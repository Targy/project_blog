# With Professor Fishman
Introduction to projects

Q: how to introduce the concept of disease? How to make game more fun instead of just giving the concepts

A: It is important in game design to find what is interesting/ challenging /engaging about the concept instead of saying how can I make something fun which would be like admitting a topic is not fun. Won’t last very long, like hiding a medicine in the ice gram and eventually you will find that it is medicine and feel tricked. I think engagement is the most important thing. When you look for what is interesting or what people are interested in, especially talks about the infection of disease, people are interested in not spreading infection. There is a built in motivation, like people avoiding obstacle/ survival ideas. And you have to make choices and there are risks associated with choices/ risks will accumulate with risk. There are all kinds of frames you can put around the subject that somebody would see as a challenge. Challenges they want to 
persist and succeed. That would make the game engaging. 

Q: I will make the game 2D based , RPG like. Making the character survived. It would be too normal. Maybe there is a better way to give the concept. Want it different than just giving the same sets that people are experiencing everyday.

A: maybe some metaphor or cover story. Creating a scenario that somebody on another planet or zombie apocalypse.
There is no limit to what possible way.

Q: Description of Mainich

A: think through what is the interesting challenge, what challenge the character is willing to accept giving the character that you are introducing them to. It gotta feel realistic, gotta feel worthwell. It can be totally fantastical. It can be a fantasy world, people choose to engage with a fiction and they accept the rules of the fiction. As long as the fiction is consistent with what you are going to participate in and enjoy it. Most people are frustrated when creators can’t stick to the primes. Like in movies where the hero is trapped in some situation and some miracle saves them. It’s not fun. They should be helped with the tools they are given, not some god intervention. That solves everything.
Another general advice for game designers is to think a lot about three things. One is “Are you giving people the chance to make choices that matter?'' because the more choices the player has, the more engaging the player will feel. Second thing is making sure you are supporting the confidence of the player. The game should not be so hard and the player would always feel like they have the resources they need so they could eventually succeed if they tried. The third thing is the sense of belonging, which is making the player feel they are part of something bigger than themselves or they are seen as an individual. These things come together to make the game engaging.

Q: how could I make the game stand out more than other media.

A: graphic won’t matter too much compared to the compelling and engaging story.I would put more energy to the story. Where the game stands out is through consistency where you pick the graphic style and the style connected to something(family style, japanese anime style,) you can use the style like what happens when people run so fast(naruto run). Or you can do something completely unique where surprising people would be interesting as well.


Key things:
-survival game?

-metophor of people on other planet?

-giving player enough choice that matter

-make sure to support the confidence of player

-sense of belonging 

-game stands out with consistency
