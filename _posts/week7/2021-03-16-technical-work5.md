# Technical Work
In phase 2, player would have two values to maintain. One is health/HP, another is sanity value/SP. Either value reach 0 would cause player to enter phase 3. Health value is mainly decreased by battle with virus and sanity value is decreasing as time goes by. The player need to talk to people to maintain the sanity value and risk the virus damage at the same time. Eventually, all the player would enter phase 3.(current plan) To simple this phase2 idea, I can just decrease certain value of HP after player talking to others.

This week, I've finished the half of the phase 2. Specifically, I've add the sanity system in the game. Because of the pandemic, player would start to stress out in phase 2 and sanity value would continuously decrese as time goes by. The player then would complain about the feeling. 

To maintain the main character's sanity, player can talk to others and gain sanity value. However, some people would walk away from player after talking like the neibor shown in the video

To make finding road more easily, I've create a new world map. Player can tell where to go from this map.

When player go to school, he can find very few people compare to phase1, but talking to these people can still gain sanity value for them.
When player can't manage to maintain the sanity value, the character would finally can't endure loneliness and go to a party which would cause him to have Covid and enter phase3

party

The next week, I will try to finish the phase 2 including battle system and health system. The shopping market is open by now and player can buy some items like mask or gloves. These items can increase player's denfense during the battle with virus and cause player to live longer in phase 2. The player would born with 500G and he can use these money to shop. More item would be availabe later.
