# Market Research

As for the market sector, my game would fall into the Arts, entertainment, & recreation sector as a game and Healthcare & social assistance sector when it relates to the COVID-19 contagion. These two sectors are really large as the Healthcare sector would generate about 2, 612 billion dollars revenue a year and the Entertainment sector would generate 678 million dollars a year. In these two sectors, there are some big leaders that occupy most of the markets. For example, New York State Lottery, The Walt Disney Company, National Park Service, Fitness International LLC and Live Nation Entertainment are the fifth largest companies from this sector. They range from sports to lottery to movies and can be found in most people’s daily life. Big companies in the Healthcare sector contain HCA Healthcare Inc. Quest Diagnostics Inc. Brookdale Senior Living Inc, Feeding America Market and CVS Health Corp. These sectors not only serve people’s lives but also produce multiple products such as sports clothes, playstations, movie discs, medicines and health supplements. 
Some products related to my project are video games like “Mainichi”, plague, Surgeon Simulator, Japan Animation "Cells at Work!" which anthropomorphize cells in human body or TV show *Rick and Morty* "Anatomy Park"(episode 3, first season) which describe a jurney in human body and introduce several viruses and diseases.
