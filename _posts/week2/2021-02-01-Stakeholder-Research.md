# Stakeholder Research

As for the primary audience of mine, the psychologists would be the first choice. Most psychologists are working at home giving counselling to people through virtual processes. They talk with patients and try to comfort them or solve their problems. They are the people who know what is happening to the people in this pandemic and witness many patientsâ€™ depression and anxiety. At this time, they are facing the challenge about how to explore the mental health issue of either Covid-19 patients or other people who live under the pressure. While most psychologists are writing academic essays about the mental health issue, it is hard for them to deliver the professional advice and research result to the public. As the psychologists, they can definitely provide their observations toward the patients and give the best suggestions. They could also provide some information related to patients that can help depict the character.
