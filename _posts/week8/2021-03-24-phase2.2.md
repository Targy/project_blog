# Technical Work

This week, I finished the phase2 of my project. The first thing to indicate is that instead of using the battle system as I planned before, I decide to use the infection rate to represent the health condition of the character. As the player talk to more people, he will have the infection rate to increase until he finally get the virus and go to phase three. I made this change because compared to health deduction, increasing Infection rate make more sense or more close to the reality.

I've also add more things in the shop that player can buy. Some of them are used for equipment while others are consumable and have one-time effects.

After last week's playtesting, sanity value now decrease faster. To balance the game, I add more interesting things player can interact to increase the sanity value.

watch TV and More!

Another secrete event can be discovered in pahse 2 is the government protesting. The player will decide whether to check out the noise in government building. If he gets in, he will find out multiple people protesting. But this event would make player more nervous.

The next week, I will implement phase 3 which is player get COVID 19. Phase 3 would consist more autoruns, videos as compared to pahse1 and phase2 since most time player would stay on the bed or in hospital.
