Trailer

After multiple play-testing, the main problem remained in my game is many player don't know what is this game about. Some of the player saying the Covid event happened too abrupt. Then, I add some hint in phase 1 to tell player there is new virus happened in China and relate player to that event. Also, I've change the name of the game to willness where will represent desire, wish and illness represent the covid. The title might also give the hint to player. I also add a new sound effect to lab work that makes it more juicy. The hint of what to do next (hint to go to the lab/ hint to go to the home) now are changed to be less frequent because some of the player are bothered by the information.
