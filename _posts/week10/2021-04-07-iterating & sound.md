# Iteration

This week, I basically add music and sound effects to the game. The background music would change in different situation like phase1, 2, 3 or when player goes into the park. Sound effects include shocking,  water tap, video game and more. 

I also fix the bugs from iteration last week which includes sign in the park, some bugs related to different phases, spell errors and park sign etc. For guidence, the player will be informed that he forget to bring the wallet and went back home would be the choice.

Next week, I will invite friends to playtesting my game and iterate based on their comments. I will also plan the presentation for the showcase.
