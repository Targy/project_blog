# Mainichi

Mainichi is a RPG game exploring the everyday life of LGPTQ. The game is really simple with only certain scenes and several events. However, the designer uses people’s reactions to explore the discrimination faced by LGPTQ people. This game’s use of conversation is shocking, the reactions come from everywhere when the character walks on the street and gives great impression to players. There are also some cons related to the game. When the game is trying to depict the modern city, it is somewhat a failure when the car and people are not moving on the street but instead stand steady. It is caused by the RPG games’ weakness. I will look for some possible solutions to this problem by play-testing some morden city theme RPG games.

Key points:
People reaction/conversation use
Solution for RPG game weakness

# Witch House

Witch house is a great horror RPG game . It consists of locked doors, monsters, letters and puzzle game elements. Some great take-aways would be the changing scene of the room when some event is triggered. For example, the vessel would suddenly fall down with a sound effect or some object would change when you go out and come back to the room. These tricks can be used in my game if I want to present the changing of time/ situation for COVID-19 event. Similarly, the game uses some music to represent the horror feeling like the sound of a clock. 
Another interesting design is the saving character/tutorial, a black cat, that is close to the story and also put at the perfect place for the player to save the progress.This game also perfectly avoids the weakness of RPG games with well-designed story line and simple scenes. 

Key points:
Saving character selection
Story line design
Sound effect importance
