# Technical Work

This week, I decided to use RPG maker MV as my project platform because it is a much cheaper one than RPG maker MZ and has most things I needed for the project. After setting up the MV version, I recreate the inside home map in MV again and finish the outside building of home, hospital and school. The inside part of the hospital is also finished. I wasn't able to find the copy/paste function until the end, which tooks me more time to set each pile. The rest map build would be faster with the copy/paste. The following pictures are the maps I created.
