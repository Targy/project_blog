# Technical Work

This week, I decided to use RPG maker MV as my project platform because it is a much cheaper one than RPG maker MZ and has most things I needed for the project. After setting up the MV version, I recreate the inside home map in MV again and finish the outside building of home, hospital and school. The inside part of the hospital is also finished. I wasn't able to find the copy/paste function until the end, which tooks me more time to set each pile. The rest map build would be faster with the copy/paste in the next week. The following pictures are the maps I created.

![]({{ page.image5 | relative_url}})  
outside school

Whole town overview

Next week, I will keep finishing the map with faster speed using copy/paste and revise based on created buildings/rooms. I will also playtesting other RPG games and see if there are any good solutions to problems I found by play testing such as unmoving car/people on street.
