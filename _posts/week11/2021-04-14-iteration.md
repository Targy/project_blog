# Technical Work

This week, I keep iterating and fixing the game. Based on the last week ir purpose of the game. During the party, player now can interact with some other people and drink the beer as well. Based on the play-testing with friends, I revise the logic of the wallet. Player will now notice he get the wallet after entering phase 2 and told player to go to coffee house when talk to the neighbor. (one of my friends thoguht the game is about finding wallet and go to restaurant in China Town....)

I've also create the itch.io to host the game for presentation in showcase. The google slide is also almost done except the demo video.
They can be found at

I have some other friends who will send me feedback on next week and I will fix the game based on their feedbacks. I will also finish the demo video and polish the itch.io webpage.
