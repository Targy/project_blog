# Technical Work

This week, I've finished the first phase of my project. The first phase is about the player waking up and experience the normal life before the pandemic. At this phase, the player can talk to people freely and there would be appear a lot of students at school.

In this phase, player would first wake up with a task indicating the meeting with Lisa at lab room.

Initial task 

After leaving the room (may or maynot find out roommate Jack has leaved), player can now explore the town. Since the town is really big, I currently made the simple guideboard to indicating the place of school.

During the road to school, player can talk to people on the road

After entering school, player can interact with multiple objects and students. Some conversation would include choices that makes the game more interactive.

The next week, I will focus on the phase two implementation which would focus more on the item system, virus-battle system and health/sanity value system. The conversations/ interactions in phase two would be much less.
